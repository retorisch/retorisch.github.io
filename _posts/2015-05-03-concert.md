On 3 May, _Het Retorisch Kwartet_, featuring Robert Andriessen, will perform at the opening of an exhibition at [Galerie Kralingen](http://www.galeriekralingen.nl/contact/index.php) that coincides with the Dutch national remembrance day on 4 May.

The programme, which will last for about fifteen minutes, includes three short pieces centred around Jean Mouton’s setting of the text [_Quis dabit oculis?_](http://www2.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Quis_dabit_oculis) - a lament written to mark the death of French queen [Anne of Brittany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Brittany) in 1514, whom Mouton worked for.
