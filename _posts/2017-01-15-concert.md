On 15 January 2017 _Het Retorisch Kwartet_ will perform a [concert at Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen](http://www.boijmans.nl/en/7/calendar-exhibitions/calendaritem/1262/fra-bartolommeo), inspired by the exhibition _Fra Bartolommeo - the Divine Renaissance_.

The programme mixes music from Heinrich Isaac, who worked in Florence at the same time as local artist Fra Bartolommeo, together with other music from the period. Isaac worked in Florence for much of his career, where he composed a number of sacred and secular works, and lived with his wife Bartolomea. 

[Johannes Martini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Martini) was a Franco-Flemish composer who also worked in Northern Italy, in Ferrara. [Costanzo Festa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costanzo_Festa) sang in the papal choir and composed in Rome, but visited Ferrara in 1514, the year he published his first known work - _Quis dabit oculis_, which laments the death of Anne of Brittany, Queen of France. One year later, the influential Franco-Flemish composer [Adrian Willaert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Willaert) also started work in Ferrara. These composers’ music from Ferrara was certainly well-known in Florence.
