At the end of June 2014, _Het Retorisch Kwartet_ will perform a concert programme near Groningen and Rotterdam, with music by Orlando di Lasso and Leonhard Lechner. Lasso was born in Mons/Hainaut in 1532 and died in 1594 in Munich. He was a prolific composer. For this concert we will present various facets of Lassus’ music: airy madrigals alongside the beautiful and dark _La Nuict froide et sombre_. As well as secular works we will present some of his sacred music, such as the chromaticism of _Christe Dei soboles_ and the polyphony of the first Lamentations of Jeremiah.

Leonard Lechner was born in 1553 in South Tyrol (northern Italy) and died in 1606 in Stuttgart. Lasso and Lechner crossed paths in Munich, where Lasso was for a long time choir master at the court of Albrecht V. As a boy, Lechner sang Lasso’s choir. This program clearly shows the transition from Lasso’s late-polyphonic style - the legacy of the great Flemish tradition - to the first signs of the trends from Italy that would radically change the music.

In summary, we will hear the transition from di Lasso’s highly developed compositional sophistication to Lechner’s more emotionally expressive music.
